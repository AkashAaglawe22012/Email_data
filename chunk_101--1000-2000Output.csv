Primary threats: max_metadata_suspicious_score(0.70) showing very high suspicious characteristics; max_behavioral_sandbox_score(0.006) indicating behavioral anomalies; max_exfiltration_behavior_score(0.65) showing HIGH data theft capability; unique_parent_process_names shows winword.exe,powershell.exe,regsvr32.exe execution indicating DLL injection techniques; html_text_ratio(1.1) showing content manipulation; total_links_detected(1) with url_reputation_score(0.75) showing suspicious destinations; SPF FAILED but DKIM/DMARC show NEUTRAL/temperror; TLS 1.3 with valid SSL. The regsvr32.exe execution combined with high metadata scores and DLL injection techniques definitively classifies this as MALICIOUS."

1041,No Action,0.43,"LOW-MODERATE RISK: Email shows authentication and sender concerns but lacks definitive malicious indicators. Notable signals: sender_known_malicious(1) showing known malicious sender but reply_path_known_malicious(1) indicating malicious reply infrastructure; request_type(wire_transfer) suggesting financial fraud attempt; very low behavioral and technical threat scores across all categories; total_links_detected(1) with valid SSL certificate; SPF PASSED but DKIM shows POLICY, DMARC FAILED; TLS 1.2 encryption. Despite known malicious sender flags, the absence of technical threats, payloads, or behavioral anomalies suggests false positive or remediated threat. Classification: NO ACTION but recommend sender blocking."

Task 22: Analysis of samples 1042-1043 (D85-D86)

1042,No Action,0.41,"LOW RISK ASSESSMENT: Email demonstrates minimal security threats with some infrastructure concerns. Positive indicators: sender_known_malicious(0) showing no threat history; no executable attachments or behavioral threats; zero YARA matches and clean behavioral scores; total_links_detected(4) with self-signed SSL certificate likely indicating configuration issues; smtp_ip_reputation_score(0.34) showing moderate sending IP concerns; SPF PASSED but DKIM/DMARC show FAILED/FAILED indicating authentication configuration problems; TLS 1.3 with adequate encryption. The authentication failures and SSL certificate issues appear to be infrastructure-related rather than malicious. Classification: NO ACTION."

1043,No Action,0.47,"LOW-MODERATE RISK: Email shows some reputation and infrastructure concerns but lacks malicious technical indicators. Notable signals: sender_temp_email_likelihood(0.11) suggesting minimal disposable email usage; return_path_reputation_score(0.28) and smtp_ip_reputation_score(0.67) showing mixed infrastructure reputation; content_spam_score(0.06) indicating minimal spam characteristics; has_executable_attachment(1) but expired SSL certificate suggesting infrastructure problems rather than malicious intent; SPF FAILED but DKIM/DMARC show NEUTRAL/temperror; TLS 1.1 encryption. Despite mixed reputation signals, the absence of behavioral threats or confirmed malicious patterns suggests legitimate but poorly configured infrastructure. Classification: NO ACTION."

Task 23: Analysis of samples 1044-1045 (D87-D88)

1044,No Action,0.44,"LOW RISK PROFILE: Email demonstrates legitimate communication characteristics with minimal security concerns. Positive indicators: sender_known_malicious(0) showing no threat history; no executable attachments or malicious behavioral indicators; zero YARA matches and clean behavioral scores; total_links_detected(1) with valid SSL certificate; low content_spam_score and normal reputation metrics; site_visual_similarity_to_known_brand(0.64) showing some visual similarity but not definitive spoofing; SPF PASSED but DKIM/DMARC show NONE/FAILED; TLS 1.2 encryption. The mixed authentication results appear to be configuration-related rather than security threats. Classification: NO ACTION."

1045,Warning,0.73,"MODERATE-HIGH SECURITY CONCERN: Email contains social engineering indicators with infrastructure anomalies. Key threats: sender_temp_email_likelihood(0.82) indicating high likelihood of disposable email usage; return_path_reputation_score(0.32) showing poor return path infrastructure; request_type(gift_card_request) typical of business email compromise attacks; smtp_ip_reputation_score(0.0007) indicating very poor sending IP reputation; Analysis_of_the_qrcode_if_present(1) indicating QR code present for potential payload delivery; SPF/DKIM/DMARC all FAILED indicating complete authentication failure; TLS 1.3 with valid SSL. The gift card request combined with complete authentication failures and QR code presence warrants WARNING classification."

Task 24: Analysis of samples 1046-1047 (D89-D90)

1046,Malicious,0.90,"CRITICAL THREAT DETECTION: Email exhibits macro-based malware with sophisticated behavioral evasion. Primary indicators: packer_detected(1) indicating obfuscated malware payload; max_behavioral_sandbox_score(4.3e-05) with max_amsi_suspicion_score(0.04) showing script-based threats; max_exfiltration_behavior_score(0.53) indicating moderate data theft capability; total_embedded_file_count(1) with unique_parent_process_names showing winword.exe execution; request_type(wire_transfer) targeting financial fraud; smtp_ip_reputation_score(0.82) showing high IP reputation (potentially compromised legitimate infrastructure); self-signed SSL certificate indicating fraudulent infrastructure; SPF/DKIM show FAILED/FAILED, DMARC shows permerror. The packer detection combined with financial targeting and infrastructure spoofing definitively classifies this as MALICIOUS."

1047,Malicious,0.94,"EXTREME THREAT LEVEL: Email represents sophisticated document-based malware campaign. Critical indicators: max_exfiltration_behavior_score(0.83) showing VERY HIGH data theft capability; reply_path_known_malicious(1) confirming malicious reply infrastructure; unique_parent_process_names shows winword.exe execution typical of document-based attacks; request_type(document_download) indicating payload delivery method; bulk_message_indicator(1) suggesting campaign distribution; content_spam_score(0.65) indicating bulk distribution disguised as legitimate communication; site_visual_similarity_to_known_brand(0.97) showing near-perfect brand spoofing; url_reputation_score(0.18) indicating suspicious destinations; SPF/DKIM FAILED, DMARC PASSED. The extreme exfiltration scores combined with perfect brand spoofing and malicious infrastructure definitively classifies this as MALICIOUS."

Task 25: Analysis of samples 1048-1049 (D91-D92)

1048,Spam,0.67,"MODERATE SPAM CLASSIFICATION: Email exhibits reputation concerns and bulk characteristics typical of spam operations. Key indicators: return_path_reputation_score(0.13) showing poor return path infrastructure; content_spam_score(0.46) indicating moderate spam likelihood; smtp_ip_reputation_score(0.28) showing poor sending IP reputation; SPF/DKIM/DMARC all FAILED indicating complete authentication failure but no advanced technical threats detected; TLS 1.3 with valid SSL providing adequate transport security; minimal behavioral or attachment-based threats. The authentication failures combined with reputation issues and spam scores suggest bulk spam rather than targeted malware. Classification: SPAM."

1049,Spam,0.71,"MODERATE SPAM CLASSIFICATION: Email demonstrates data harvesting spam characteristics with infrastructure concerns. Key signals: sender_domain_reputation_score(0.53) showing moderate reputation concerns; request_type(sensitive_data_request) indicating data collection attempt; return_path_reputation_score(0.17) and smtp_ip_reputation_score(0.18) showing poor infrastructure reputation; site_visual_similarity_to_known_brand(0.07) showing minimal brand spoofing; SPF shows SOFTFAIL, DKIM/DMARC show NONE/temperror indicating authentication issues; TLS 1.2 with valid SSL; very low behavioral and technical threat scores. The sensitive data requests combined with infrastructure reputation issues suggest information harvesting spam rather than advanced malware. Classification: SPAM."
