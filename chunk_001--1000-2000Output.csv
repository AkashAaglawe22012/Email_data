Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D94,Malicious,0.85,"HIGH RISK: Executable attachment with unscannable components, winword.exe execution, suspicious metadata, meeting_request social engineering, extremely long sandbox execution time suggests evasive behavior. Despite passing email authentication, document-based malware characteristics are evident."
D95,Malicious,0.92,"VERY HIGH RISK: Multiple YARA rule matches (3), high behavioral sandbox score, significant AMSI suspicion score indicating script-based threats, DMARC authentication failure, winword.exe process execution, URL redirect chains (3), outdated TLS 1.0, self-signed SSL certificate. Strong indicators of document-based malware with authentication bypass attempts."
D96,Spam,0.75,"MODERATE RISK: Very high temporary email likelihood (0.907), DMARC authentication failure, mixed authentication results but no malicious file indicators, no executable attachments, no process execution, no suspicious behavioral scores. Primarily bulk/spam email from disposable email service."
D97,Malicious,0.95,"CRITICAL RISK: Packer/obfuscation detected, 2 malicious attachments confirmed, dual process execution (winword.exe + outlook.exe), legal_threat social engineering, SPF authentication failure, DMARC temporary error, high behavioral sandbox scores, high metadata suspicious scores. Multiple vectors indicate sophisticated malware delivery."
D98,Malicious,0.88,"HIGH RISK: High-value target (VIP=1), acrobat.exe process execution, link_click social engineering, expired SSL certificate, high site visual similarity to known brand (0.657), high URL reputation risk, high URL rendering behavior score. Sophisticated phishing campaign targeting executives with brand impersonation."
D99,Warning,0.35,"LOW-MODERATE RISK: Bank detail update request type raises caution, SPF authentication failure, but extremely low malicious indicators across all file/behavioral categories, very low content spam score, good DKIM/DMARC results, secure TLS 1.3. Likely legitimate but requires verification due to financial nature."
D100,Malicious,0.91,"VERY HIGH RISK: High metadata suspicious score (0.301), dual process execution (winword.exe + powershell.exe), vpn_or_mfa_reset social engineering targeting credential theft, high behavioral sandbox scores, self-signed SSL certificate, 3 embedded files. Advanced persistent threat characteristics with credential harvesting intent."
D100,Malicious,0.89,"HIGH RISK: High temporary email likelihood (0.389), very high behavioral sandbox score (0.890), dual process execution (winword.exe + powershell.exe), vpn_or_mfa_reset social engineering, high content spam score (0.561), authentication failures (SPF fail). Credential phishing campaign from disposable email infrastructure."
D81,Spam,0.68,"MODERATE RISK: High temporary email likelihood (0.579), moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.146), dual process execution (winword.exe + powershell.exe), high content spam score (0.100), mixed authentication results, DMARC failure. Bulk spam campaign with some suspicious behavioral indicators."
D82,No Action,0.25,"LOW RISK: Very low malicious indicators across all categories, invoice_verification request type is business-legitimate, good authentication (SPF pass, DMARC temperror acceptable), secure TLS 1.3, minimal behavioral scores, low spam indicators. Legitimate business communication requiring no action."
D83,Warning,0.42,"MODERATE RISK: DMARC enforced (good), dual process execution (winword.exe + powershell.exe), self-signed SSL certificate, URL redirect chains (3), mixed authentication results (DKIM none), but overall low behavioral sandbox scores and minimal malicious indicators. Requires monitoring due to process execution patterns."
D84,Malicious,0.94,"CRITICAL RISK: 4 YARA rule matches, 4 embedded files, triple process execution (winword.exe + powershell.exe + regsvr32.exe), 7 URLs detected, extremely high site visual similarity to known brand (0.967), expired SSL certificate, high URL reputation risks. Sophisticated multi-stage malware with brand impersonation and DLL injection capabilities."
