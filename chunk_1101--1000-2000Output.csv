Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D94,Warning,0.75,"Email shows concerning patterns: executable attachment (has_executable_attachment=1), moderate exfiltration behavior score (0.695), embedded files detected (total_embedded_file_count=7), low domain reputation (0.197), and meeting request type. The presence of winword.exe parent process with executable attachments and network behavior raises suspicion. SPF/DKIM failures compound the risk, but no direct malicious indicators confirm malware."
D95,Malicious,0.85,"Strong malicious indicators: domain flagged as malicious (domain_known_malicious=1), very low domain reputation (2.01e-17), high sandbox execution score (1.017), suspicious parent processes including winword.exe, SPF fail/DMARC fail, self-signed SSL certificate with high visual similarity to known brands (0.657). The combination of authentication failures, malicious domain, and suspicious attachment behavior strongly indicates phishing or malware delivery."
D96,Spam,0.70,"Email exhibits spam characteristics: high sender temp email likelihood (0.907), URL shortener detected, no executable attachments, all authentication checks pass, but very low domain reputation (8.93e-09). The marketing-style content with temporary email patterns and URL shorteners suggests commercial spam rather than malicious intent."
D97,Malicious,0.90,"Critical malicious signals: packer detected in attachment (packer_detected=1), malicious attachment count of 2, high metadata suspicious score (0.501), multiple embedded files, legal threat request type, SPF fail, high content spam score (0.044), and suspicious sandbox behavior. The obfuscated attachments with legal threat social engineering strongly indicate BEC or malware attack."
D98,Warning,0.65,"Mixed risk signals: moderate domain tech stack match score indicating potential spoofing, link click request type, some embedded files detected, but authentication passes and no direct malicious indicators. The combination of potential domain spoofing with link click requests warrants caution but lacks definitive malicious markers."
D99,No Action,0.80,"Clean email profile: all authentication checks pass, very low threat scores across all attachment analysis metrics, bank detail update request but with legitimate authentication, no suspicious attachments or behaviors detected. Despite the sensitive request type, the strong authentication and clean technical profile suggest legitimate business communication."
D100,Malicious,0.88,"High-risk indicators: multiple suspicious parent processes (winword.exe, powershell.exe), high sandbox behavioral score (0.890), embedded files with suspicious activity, VPN/MFA reset request targeting security controls, self-signed SSL certificate. The PowerShell execution combined with security control targeting strongly suggests credential theft attempt."
D100,Warning,0.72,"Concerning patterns: same parent processes as previous (winword.exe, powershell.exe), VPN/MFA reset request, but lower behavioral scores and passed some authentication checks. The security-focused request with PowerShell activity raises red flags but lacks the stronger malicious indicators of the previous entry."
D81,Warning,0.70,"Mixed signals: executable attachment risk with winword.exe and powershell.exe processes, moderate exfiltration score (0.543), but authentication mostly passes. The PowerShell activity is concerning but overall threat scores remain moderate, suggesting potentially unwanted but not definitively malicious behavior."
D82,No Action,0.75,"Clean profile: no executable attachments, no malicious indicators, invoice verification request with passing authentication. Despite the financial context, all technical indicators show legitimate email characteristics with no suspicious attachment behaviors or authentication failures."
D83,Malicious,0.82,"Strong malicious indicators: DMARC enforced but failing checks (dmarc_enforced=1 with failures), self-signed SSL certificate, high visual similarity to known brand (0.445), suspicious parent processes. The authentication bypass attempt with brand impersonation strongly suggests phishing attack."
D84,Warning,0.78,"Elevated risk: multiple parent processes including regsvr32.exe (known for malware), 4 YARA rule matches, 4 embedded files, expired SSL certificate, very high site similarity to known brand (0.967). The regsvr32 usage with YARA hits indicates suspicious activity but lacks confirmed malicious payloads."
D85,Spam,0.65,"Spam characteristics: wire transfer request, unsubscribe link present, bulk message indicators, but clean attachment profile and passing authentication. The financial request seems to be part of a mass campaign rather than targeted attack."
D86,No Action,0.70,"Legitimate profile: all major security checks pass, no malicious attachments, self-signed certificate but in valid communication context. Technical indicators suggest legitimate internal or small business communication."
D87,No Action,0.85,"Clean email: strong authentication (all pass), no suspicious attachments, valid SSL certificate, no malicious domains or IPs. All technical indicators point to legitimate communication."
D88,Spam,0.75,"Classic spam profile: high sender domain reputation but suspicious content patterns, self-signed SSL, marketing keywords likely present. The misalignment between sender reputation and content suggests reputation hijacking for spam delivery."
D89,Spam,0.80,"Spam indicators: gift card request (common scam), DMARC enforced but failing authentication, high temp email likelihood (0.865), reply path differs from sender. Classic gift card scam pattern with authentication spoofing."
D90,Malicious,0.92,"Critical malicious signals: macro-enabled document detected (any_macro_enabled_document=1), packer detected, wire transfer request, authentication failures across SPF/DKIM, self-signed SSL. The macro-enabled document with financial request and authentication failures strongly indicates malware-based financial fraud."
D91,Malicious,0.88,"High-risk profile: reply path differs from sender (spoofing indicator), return path known malicious, document download request, high content spam score (0.652), authentication failures. The malicious return path with document download trap indicates phishing campaign."
D92,No Action,0.80,"Clean technical profile: no malicious attachments, authentication passes, legitimate domain patterns. Despite being marked for analysis, shows no concerning security indicators."
D93,Warning,0.68,"Mixed signals: sensitive data request with some authentication failures but no malicious attachments or domains. The data request warrants caution but lacks technical malicious indicators."
D94,Warning,0.75,"Moderate risk: meeting request with some embedded files, mixed authentication results, but no confirmed malicious components. Business context suggests caution but not immediate threat."
D95,Malicious,0.85,"Malicious indicators: domain known malicious, high spam content score (0.822), authentication failures, unsubscribe link (phishing disguise), URL shortener detected. Classic phishing campaign characteristics."
D96,No Action,0.82,"Legitimate profile: clean attachment analysis, good authentication, no malicious domains despite self-signed SSL. Internal or small business legitimate communication."
D97,Malicious,0.90,"Critical threat: legal threat social engineering, reply path differs from sender, high visual similarity to brands, multiple authentication failures. Sophisticated BEC attack using legal threats for urgency."
D98,Malicious,0.88,"High-risk: VBScript/JavaScript detected (any_vbscript_javascript_detected=1), link click request, high content spam score (0.838), self-signed SSL, brand similarity. Script-based attack vector with phishing characteristics."
D99,Warning,0.65,"Moderate concern: bank detail update request with mixed authentication, unsubscribe link present. Financial request requires verification but technical indicators are mixed."
D100,Malicious,0.95,"Severe threat: domain reputation extremely poor (0.951), suspicious parent processes, unscannable attachment present, VPN/MFA reset targeting security, expired SSL. Sophisticated attack targeting security controls with obfuscated payloads."
D93,Spam,0.72,"Spam profile: sensitive data request, bulk indicators, failing authentication. Mass phishing campaign rather than targeted attack."
D94,Warning,0.70,"Moderate risk: embedded files with suspicious entropy, meeting request, softfail SPF. Suspicious characteristics but not definitively malicious."
D95,Malicious,0.87,"Malicious profile: domain known malicious, high reputation score (0.672), URL shortener, failing authentication. Clear phishing indicators with reputation masking."
D96,Spam,0.75,"Spam characteristics: temporary email likelihood high (0.766), clean attachments but poor authentication. Bulk campaign indicators."
D97,Malicious,0.85,"Threat indicators: reply path differs from sender, legal threat, high AMSI score (0.964). BEC attack with social engineering focus."
D98,Malicious,0.82,"Malicious markers: executable attachment, link click trap, self-signed SSL, suspicious string entropy. Malware delivery via deceptive links."
D99,Warning,0.60,"Low-moderate risk: bank details request but with good authentication and clean attachments. Requires business verification."
D100,Malicious,0.91,"High threat: malicious file hash detected (any_file_hash_malicious=1), suspicious processes, VPN/MFA reset. Confirmed malware with credential theft objectives."
D100,Warning,0.73,"Elevated risk: same process patterns, VPN/MFA targeting but lower severity scores. Related to previous threat but less definitive."
D81,Warning,0.71,"Moderate risk: PowerShell activity, mixed authentication, no confirmed malware. Suspicious but not confirmed threat."
D82,Spam,0.65,"Spam indicators: invoice verification with poor sender reputation, bulk patterns. Commercial spam rather than targeted attack."
D83,Malicious,0.89,"Strong threat: high sender domain reputation (0.523) but failing authentication, expired SSL. Reputation hijacking for phishing delivery."
D84,Malicious,0.86,"Malicious profile: regsvr32.exe process (malware indicator), high sandbox score, embedded files. Code execution attempt via malicious attachments."
D85,Warning,0.62,"Moderate concern: sender known malicious flag but clean attachments, wire transfer request. Requires verification despite sender flag."
