Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D94,Warning,75%,"Email has executable attachment with high exfiltration behavior score (0.6953) and suspicious string entropy (7). Meeting request type could be social engineering. However authentication passes (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) and no malicious domains detected. Requires caution but not definitively malicious."
D95,Malicious,95%,"Critical indicators: Known malicious domain flagged, DMARC authentication failure, self-signed SSL certificate, high brand impersonation similarity (0.6574), multiple URL redirects, YARA rule matches (3), high exfiltration behavior score (0.8678). Clear malicious intent."
D96,Spam,80%,"Very high temporary email likelihood (0.9070), DMARC authentication failure, URL shortener detected for obfuscation. However no malicious attachments, domains, or exploit patterns detected. Low spam score suggests legitimate content with suspicious sender characteristics."
D97,Malicious,90%,"Multiple critical indicators: 2 malicious attachments, packer detected (obfuscation), legal threat request type (social engineering), SPF authentication failure, moderate brand impersonation (0.4709), high exfiltration behavior score (0.6495). Clear malicious attack pattern."
D98,Malicious,85%,"Targeting high-risk role (CEO/CFO level), link click request type, expired SSL certificate, high exfiltration behavior score (0.8143), high suspicious string entropy (6), good URL reputation score (0.7014) indicates sophisticated attack. Targeted spear-phishing attempt."
D99,Malicious,95%,"Critical BEC attack: Bank detail update request, complete authentication failure (SPF/DKIM fail, no DMARC), extremely poor domain reputation (3e-10). Classic business email compromise attempting financial fraud through bank detail changes."
D100,Malicious,90%,"VPN/MFA credential harvesting attempt with suspicious process chain (winword.exe->powershell.exe), self-signed SSL certificate, high exfiltration behavior (0.6858), DKIM authentication failure, zero domain reputation. Advanced persistent threat characteristics."
D81,Spam,75%,"High temporary email likelihood (0.5791), DMARC authentication failure, suspicious process chain, moderate spam score (0.1004), moderate exfiltration behavior. Characteristics suggest spam campaign rather than targeted attack but requires monitoring."
D82,Warning,70%,"Invoice verification request (potential BEC), DKIM policy failure, DMARC temporary error, high-risk ASN (0.8481) associated with malicious activity. Authentication issues and request type warrant caution but lacks definitive malicious indicators."
D83,Warning,75%,"Suspicious process chain (winword.exe->powershell.exe), self-signed SSL certificate, moderate brand impersonation (0.4450), very poor domain reputation, outdated TLS 1.0. DMARC enforced is positive but overall pattern suggests potential threat requiring monitoring."
D84,Malicious,95%,"Extremely high brand impersonation (0.9673), critical process chain including regsvr32.exe (living-off-the-land technique), 4 YARA rule matches, expired SSL certificate, 7 URLs in email, high VIP name similarity. Sophisticated attack with multiple IOCs."
D85,Malicious,85%,"Wire transfer request (classic BEC), complete authentication failure (SPF fail, DKIM policy fail, no DMARC), very poor domain reputation, partial tech stack mismatch. Direct financial fraud attempt through wire transfer social engineering."
